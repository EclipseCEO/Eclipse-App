### About
The Eclipse app doesn't have a specific genre or aim. The plan is to pack as much into it as possible, so that there's a bit of everything.

### Download
Please note that this is not a full-on Android app. It's a WebView APK of the website hosted in this repo. This is to keep it lightweight and resource optimised.

### FAQ
Q: Why isn't Eclipse already a full stack app?
A: Honestly, I just don't have the time to develop it yet. When I work on a project, I like to focus on only that for hours.  
<br> 
Q: Why do You host the websites on GitHub and not a dedicated domain?
A: While having a custom domain would be good, GitHub has good attack prevention. Why waste money on security when I can get it for free? I guess I'm just cheap, lol.  
<br> 
Q: Are there any other Developers or People working on this app?
A: I'm a control freak, only I work on My projects. To prevent being betrayed or anything going wrong. If something does mess up, I'm the only one to blame.
